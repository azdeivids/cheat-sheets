Can only be done with files that are already being tracked                                                                                 |

| `git push <GitHub copy of repository><branch>` <br/> e.g.`git push origin main` | Push the changes to remote GitHub repository (It is a good practice to do pull prior to pushin any changed to the remote repository)                                                                                      |

You can follow up with `git add .` & `git commit -m <Comment line>`                                                    |
| `rm -rf .git`                                                                   | Deleting the *.git* folder will remove the project from the git repository                                                                                                                                                |
| `git pull <repository><brach>` <br/> `git pull origin master`                   | Pull down any changes made in the remote repository. It is best practice to do this prior to every `git push`. This will ensure that the repository is all up to data and that all the changes have been synced correctly |
| `git reset HEAD <file-name>`                                                    | Un-stage a file from git staging area (revert changes made to the file; move the file to the working directory)                                                                                                           |
| `git checkout --<file-name>`                                                    | Get back to the last commit state                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `git mv <current-file-name> <new-file=name>`                                    | Rename a file. Git will stage the file' you can back out the rename or commit the file with the new name `git commit -m "File renamed"`                                                                                   |

| `git add -u`                                                                    | Update the index; let's git know that you have re-named a file rather than just adding the file                                                                                                                           |
| `git rm <file-name>`                                                            | Delete already tracked file. Follow up with `git commit`. Use `git reset HEAD` to un-stage the deletion. Use `git checkout` to get the file back in the git directory                                                     |
| `git log`                                                                       | Look at the commit history. Each commit is identified by SHA key, author details, commit data, and comment made during the commit                                                                                         |
| `git log --all --graph --decorate --online`                                     | Create a simplified table with all the commits made                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `.gitignore`                                                                    | Create a file within git directory where you can add specific files and/or folders to be ignored by git. File paterns can also be specified                                                                               |
